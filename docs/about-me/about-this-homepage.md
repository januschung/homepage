# About this Homepage

While chatting with my ex-coworker and buddy about job hunting and project, we came up with an idea to build a *personal homepage* since a lot of job application is asking for it.

I think it is a good idea since it is a good way to showcase not only the skillset and work experience in a more presentable way, compare to boring pdf/word document, but also provides more content about how we are outside of work.

## Mkdocs Material

From the new trick that I learned in my new job, I built this personal homepage once again (the last time was a school project using plain HTML and javascript). It uses Mkdocs Material which provides a simple but yet professional theme that works well in any devices with built in responsiveness. It is easy to use __without__ any coding skill whatsoever, as it just requires some light modification of a configuration yaml file and adding/editing markdown file(s) for your contents.

## Free Publishing and Hosting with Github Page

Another good thing is, not only the source code of the homepage can be hosted on Github, but also the web hosting is provided for free with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Powered with [Github Action](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions), Github will build and deploy the homepage for you automatically. The process is fully automated so that the next time you when add or edit your homepage to your Github repo, the change will be deployed within a minute without further work required.

I hope this can help my buddy to build a good porfolio, as well as to get a dream job soon in this troublesome tech job market. If anyone of you is interested in learning more, feel free to contact and I am happy to help.
